# Bundles

The idea is to make cool bundles so we can build on the admin. Let's list some.

### [Theme bundle](https://github.com/disjfa/glynn-theme-bundle)

This is the basic theme used for the admin.

### [Mozaic bundle](https://github.com/disjfa/mozaic-bundle)

Bundle we made for a puzzle [website](http://mozaic.dimme.nl). If you want you can add it to your own.

### Input welcome

Please feel free to tell me if you have a bundle, it it is open source and awesome
we will add it to the list.
